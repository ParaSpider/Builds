Builds
======

A repository for builds created, organized or initiated by funkystudios. I don't expect many maps to make it to the Avicus Network rotations and many will just be small projects of mine for the purpose of experimentation. Feel free to download and explore my maps to your computer, but do not send any maps to other users or servers without explicit permission from the map creator which in most instances, for this repository, will be me.

Formatting Conventions
----

In order to keep this repository nice and clean and orderly, please keep to the following naming and formatting standards.

- Each build must contain a screenshots folder that each contain folders according to the version at which the screenshot was taken. Screenshots should document changes to a map.
- Versions should be in the format: "MAJOR.MINOR [D/PR/R]" where "D" indicates in development, "PR" indicates pre-release, and "R" indicates a final release of the build and to be submitted to the Avicus Network. Examples listed below:
  - **0.2 [D]**, **1.2 [PR]**, **2.3 [R]**
